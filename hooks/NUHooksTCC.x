// five stackshots show the same wedge, it survives the master toggle being off
// (this %ctor never consulted prefs), it disappears when the tweak is uninstalled,
// and iOS 17/18 — where this group is not installed at all — are unaffected.
// They were only ever *needed* for the iOS 16 enqueue-response decode.

// @catch up the stack can see it (the enqueue itself already succeeded first). So
// don't let the throwing chain run at all: decode the library reference as nil.
// MediaRemoteUI can't use a real one here anyway, so nil is equivalent-and-safe.
